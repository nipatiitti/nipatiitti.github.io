				I was part of React Native app project for the international scout jambore Roihu 2016. We made app called <span style="font-style: italic;">Roihu 2016</span>. I was part of the front end development team. During the project i learned how to code in React, React Native and how to work with big groups on developing. I also learned lot about git and other version management stuff. After that i have done couple of different React Native apps without publishing them.

				I have done quite bit of python. In my high school we had a python course and I participated. That was fun course and I got good number from it. For my final project there I did <span style="font-style: italic;">Python email crawler</span>. (Check the github link) On that project I learned how to make PyQt5 GUI, multithreading and Python networking stuff. After all I'm bit proud of that software. After making that project I also learned to make .exe from python. I haven't done any website things with python but I'm working on it to add it on my tool list.

		<h1>HTML, CSS AND JS</h1>
		<p>
			HTML was the first language I learned myself. When I learned HTML i also teached myself CSS and Js. By this day they are one of my strongest language sets. I haven't really done any backend stuff in web development but I'm familiar with js sockets + node.js and jQuery + Ajax. As example of my skills you can take a look at this site. It's dynamic and it has full mobile support.

				I love game development. I just love the feeling when you do a good game and see your friends playing it. For game development I use Unity and C#. I have done many games but only finished few and published one. I like making 2D games but i have also done few 3D ones. The one I published was called <span style="font-style: italic;">Little Rocket</span>. I published it with my own developer accounts  and during the process I learned lot about publishing apps for Apple and Google stores. Feel free to go and test it yourself ;)

				C++ was the first language i ever coded. On 9th grade i had code classes that started with C++ and after that with arduino coding. I fell in love with coding and even bought myself an arduino back then (Now i have three). After that i have learned many new languages and developed new skills in the old ones. I really like all code languages originated from C. I think it has something to do with C++ as my first language. Here is one of my Arduino works. It was the code for self driving car I made myself. The car wasn't really beatiful but it worked like dream.

		<h1>MOBILE DEVELOPMENT</h1>
		<p>
			At last but not least Mobile Development. It isn't really a language but i decided to write about it anyway. Mobile phones are big platoform and getting bigger day by day. I have a lot of experience working with them on many languages. On native and on web for Apple and for Android. I have also gained some experience on publishing side on both appstores. I'm still trying to get better and I know that there is still so much more to learn but I face it with the joy of learning and do my best to master it.
